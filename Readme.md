# Taibiex Private API

## Introduction

## Contribution

We use the DGS framework to build the GraphQL API. The DGS framework is a GraphQL framework for Spring Boot. It is a lightweight, modular framework that allows you to build GraphQL servers with ease.

There are two parts. The first part is the graphql API to provide data to the frontend. The second part is the subgraphs client to fetch data from the subgraphs services.

### Development Environment

- JDK 17
- Maven 3.8.6
